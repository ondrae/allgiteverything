# #helpwanted

## GitHub issues that need your help. üëè

## What
Easily gather all of the help wanted issues from any GitHub projects you choose, and show them off in one place.

## Why
Open source is hard. Organizing lots of volunteers around lots of open source projects is even harder. This service is meant to create one easy place to point volunteer to. Featured issues show up first.

## How
Create a collection of repositories, like all of your favorite open source bicycling projects, and embed the help wanted issues on to your main website. Easy. If the open source contributors in your crew want to ship faster, encourage them to start using the default `help wanted` label on their issues.

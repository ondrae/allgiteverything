# #helpwanted

## GitHub issues that need your help. üëè

## What
Easily gather all of the help wanted issues from any GitHub projects you choose, and show them off in one place.

## Why
Open source is hard. Organizing lots of volunteers around lots of open source projects is even harder. This service is meant to create one easy place to point volunteer to.

## How
1. Login with GitHub - http://helpwanted.team/users/auth/github
2. Create a collection - http://helpwanted.team/collections/new
3. Add a GitHub organization or repository to pull issues from
4. Send out the link to your collection
6. Embed the issues in your own site
